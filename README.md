# Automated Student Registration System

It is my first Project of backend. Used Java as Programming language and used SQL as database to store all the data.
Admin password and username has been hardcode . Admin username = "username" and password = "password".

Dynamic function for students and authectication process before changing any personal details.

Separate functions created for both Admin and Student so both have different responsibilities and access.
